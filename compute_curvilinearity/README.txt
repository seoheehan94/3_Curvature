#Rectilinearity Index Toolbox (MATLAB)



Description of contents:

applyFilters_Normalize_Average.m : will run and index angle presence within a set of images that the user provides

applyAngleFilters_AllRotations.m : a function that will convolve an image with an angle of a given spatial frequency at different rotational angles

AngleFilter.m : a function that will return an angle filter with the parameters provided

NOTE:
Before using these methods on your stimulus of interest, you should try running these scripts on a set of images where you know what the expected output will be (e.g., comparing images of circles vs. squares).
